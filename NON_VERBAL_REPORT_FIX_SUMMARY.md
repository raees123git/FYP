# Non-Verbal Report Data Flow Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The non-verbal report data was inconsistent between what was generated during interview completion and what was stored in the database. The report was being recalculated at different stages, leading to different values (e.g., wordsPerMinute showing 98 in one place and 76 in another).

## Root Cause
1. The non-verbal report page was **recalculating** analytics from raw interview data instead of using the stored analytics from the completion page
2. Extra fields (eye_contact_score, body_language_score, etc.) were being added when saving to database that weren't part of the original generated report

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Interview Completion Page (`complete/page.jsx`)
- Generates non-verbal analytics ONCE with specific fields:
  - `totalWords`, `totalTime`, `wordsPerMinute`
  - `speechRate`, `speechRateColor`, `speechRateDescription`
  - `fillerWords`, `fillerPercentage`, `detectedFillerWords`
  - `pauseAnalysis` (with pattern, description, type, recommendation)
  - `questionCount`
- Stores this in localStorage as `nonVerbalAnalysis`
- Sends exactly this data structure to database (wrapped in `analytics` object)

### 2. Non-Verbal Report Page (`non-verbal/page.jsx`)
**FIXED**: Now prioritizes using stored analytics:
```javascript
// First check if analytics already exists in localStorage
const storedNonVerbalAnalysis = localStorage.getItem("nonVerbalAnalysis");

if (storedNonVerbalAnalysis) {
  // Use stored analytics directly - NO RECALCULATION
  const analyticsData = parsedAnalysis.analytics || parsedAnalysis;
  setAnalytics(analyticsData);
  
  // Save to database with exact same data
  saveNonVerbalReport(interview, analyticsData);
}
```

### 3. Database Storage
- Stores ONLY the `analytics` object with exact content from completion page
- No additional fields like `eye_contact_score`, `body_language_score`, etc.
- Structure in database:
```json
{
  "analytics": {
    "totalWords": 62,
    "totalTime": 38,
    "wordsPerMinute": 98,
    "speechRate": "Slow Pace",
    "speechRateColor": "text-yellow-400",
    "speechRateDescription": "...",
    "fillerWords": 0,
    "fillerPercentage": "0.0",
    "detectedFillerWords": {},
    "pauseAnalysis": {...},
    "questionCount": 1
  }
}
```

### 4. Interview Details Page
- Correctly accesses `nonVerbalReport.analytics?.wordsPerMinute`
- Displays the stored data without any recalculation

## Data Flow
1. **Interview Completion** → Generate analytics ONCE → Store in localStorage
2. **Save to Database** → Send exact analytics object
3. **View Report** → Use stored analytics from localStorage (no recalculation)
4. **View Past Interview** → Retrieve from database → Display as stored

## Key Changes Made
1. Modified `calculateAnalytics` function in non-verbal report page to prioritize stored data
2. Removed extra fields from `saveNonVerbalReport` function
3. Ensured consistent data structure throughout the flow

## Result
- Non-verbal report data is now consistent across all views
- No recalculation happens after initial generation
- Database stores exactly what was generated during interview completion
